~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | Mission Statement |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Target Audience -

Beginner musicians Learning 
about the basics of scale 
patters and intervals 

- Problem being solved -

The user imputs any note to
use as the tonic, as well as 
the type of scale, and the 
program outputs all the notes
of that scale as well as other
useful information like chords

- Why it will be useful -

This will help any new musicians
understand the patters and theory
of different scales. As a beginner
musician, I had trouble for a while
understanding how scale patterns work,
and I believe this will help.
